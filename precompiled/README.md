Make sure you launch cmake with these parameters,

cmake .. -DUSE_KISAK_PHYSICS=0 -DUSE_BULLET_PHYSICS=0 -DUSE_BULLET_PHYSICS_THREADED=0

**You can set your other flags the way that you want, you just need turn off these flags.**

And put this .so file to game/bin/linux64/vphysics_client.so

Message me if you want the source code of this fixed physics!
